# dsc609
This machine learning project will implement facial recognition and tracking
on a drone. If time permits, object tracking and commands will be implemented
as well.


<b>NOTES:</b><br>
12 April 2021
- Committed first files

10 April 2021
- Selected PyTorch for the ML framework.
- Selected MTCNN for facial detection. Considered Haar Cascade, but implementation for GPU is not feasible from the ground up given limited timeframe.

9 April 2021
- Researching different methods for the pipeline.
- Facial recognition for a drone implies:
  - drone with camera
  - GPU on static system
  - language and libraries to use GPU
  - facial detection algorithm
  - facial recognition algorithm
  - (if time) facial/object tracking
- Drone chosen. Working through the theoretical and pragmatic
- challenges of different detection algorithms.

7 April 2021
- Wrote main script as tester to ensure drone viablility.
